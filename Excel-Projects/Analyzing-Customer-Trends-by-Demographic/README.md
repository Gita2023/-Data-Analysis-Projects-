In this project, I embarked on a journey to understand customer trends by demographic, aiming to develop products tailored to specific customer segments and enhance targeted marketing campaigns to ultimately boost company sales. By diving deep into customer data and utilizing advanced Excel functionalities, I was able to identify key insights, such as preferences and behaviors, across different demographic groups. Armed with this valuable information, I'm now equipped to create tailored products and targeted marketing strategies that resonate with our diverse customer base.
