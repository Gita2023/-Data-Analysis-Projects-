My Latest Power BI Project



I recently worked on the Adventure-Works-Data dataset to answer a crucial business question: **How can we increase company sales?**



I developed three data models to gain insights:



1. Flat Schema: Simple integration of all data into one table.

2. Star Schema: Central fact table linked to dimension tables for optimized queries and easy visualization.

3. Snowflake Schema: Normalized dimension tables to reduce redundancy and enhance data integrity.



Key Insights:

- Identified top-performing products and regions.

- Analyzed customer purchasing patterns for personalized strategies.

- Detected sales trends for better forecasting.



Recommendations:

- Target marketing on high-performing regions and products.

- Implement customer loyalty programs.

- Adjust inventory based on seasonal trends.



This project showcased the power of data-driven decision-making in driving sales growth.
