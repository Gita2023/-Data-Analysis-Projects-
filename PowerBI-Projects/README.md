Visualizing Sales Insights with Adventure Works Dataset

In my Power BI project, I took on the challenge of generating interactive visualizations to communicate sales insights simply and effectively using the Adventure Works sales dataset. Here are some highlights of what I accomplished:
- Created interactive filters with slicers for product category and payment method fields, enhancing user experience and enabling dynamic exploration of data.
- Developed a stacked column chart to visualize Order Total by Product Size and category, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance across different product segments.
- Crafted a donut chart to showcase Order Total share by Product Subcategory, allowing for a quick and intuitive understanding of sales distribution.
- Built a table displaying the top 10 products by Order Total, facilitating easy identification of high-performing products.
