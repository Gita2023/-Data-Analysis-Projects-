Case 1: Data Cleansing for Accurate Insights

Challenge:
Adventure Works needed to analyze sales data, but the raw dataset (SalesFile.csv) contained numerous errors, including missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies.

Approach:
To tackle this, I utilized Power BI's Power Query Editor. My process involved:

- Cleaning: Addressing missing values to ensure completeness.
- Correcting: Fixing incorrect data types to maintain data integrity.
- Standardizing: Ensuring consistent formatting across the dataset.

Outcome:
With the cleaned data as a solid foundation, I developed a comprehensive Power BI report that enabled accurate and insightful sales analysis for Adventure Works.

 Case 2: Merging Data for Unified Reporting

Challenge:
After acquiring a new bicycle business, Adventure Works needed to integrate the new sales data (OtherSales.xlsx) with their existing sales data (AdventureWorksSales.xlsx).

Solution:
I created a Power BI query to seamlessly merge data from both Excel files by:

- Renaming Columns: Ensuring common columns had the same names for smooth integration.
- Cleaning Data: Removing unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.

Outcome:
The unified dataset allowed Adventure Works to track sales comprehensively across their entire business, enhancing their reporting capabilities.


 Case 3: Unveiling Hidden Insights Through Data Joins

Challenge:
Adventure Works' sales data was fragmented across multiple tables, such as Sales and Product, making it difficult to get a complete view of their sales performance.

Strategy: 
Using Power BI's data join capabilities, I merged the Sales.xlsx and Product.xlsx tables based on the common "ProductKey" column. This process involved:

- Joining Tables: Combining tables to bring together crucial sales details.
- Enhancing Analysis: Including essential columns like Order Date, Product Name, Quantity, and Unit Price for comprehensive insights.

Outcome:
The merged data provided Adventure Works with a holistic view of their sales operations, allowing for deeper and more actionable analysis.
